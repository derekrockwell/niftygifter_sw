# Nifty Gifter Startup Weekend Minneapolis 2012

This is the codebase our team demonstrated that I built for SW 2012 for Nifty Gifter. We were selected by a panel of judges as the winners of the competition. Note this code is largely unedited (other than removing sensitive variables) from what I built within the 54 hour time limit. Kept un-refactored for posterity reasons :).

# Primary technologies leveraged:
- Ruby on Rails
- JQuery Mobile
- Amazon API
- Barcode Scanning (courtsey of pic2shop and zxing)

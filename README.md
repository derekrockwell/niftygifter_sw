# Nifty Gifter Startup Weekend Minneapolis 2012

This is the codebase our team demonstrated that I built for SW 2012 for [Nifty Gifter](http://tech.mn/news/2012/11/04/nifty-gifter-startup-weekend-twin-cities-4-winner/). We were selected by a panel of judges as the winners of the competition. Note this code is largely unedited (other than removing sensitive variables) from what I built within the 54 hour time limit. Kept un-refactored for posterity reasons :). If you're reading this, may I beg forgiveness for any best-practices I may have eschewed due to the imposed time limit!

# Primary technologies leveraged:
- Ruby on Rails
- JQuery Mobile
- Amazon API
- Barcode Scanning (courtsey of pic2shop and zxing)

It was an excellent event and I plan to eventually document the learnings from it. For now, this repository will just live here largely as a reminder to myself. Thanks to the [@niftygifter](https://twitter.com/NiftyGifter1) team!
